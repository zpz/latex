% Developed by Zepu Zhang.
% This style should be used in a document of class 'beamer'.
% It fixes some default settings for my own use.

% Choose themes. This should be set in the preamble of the document.
% Some that I like:
%\usetheme{CambridgeUS}
%\usetheme{Boadilla}


%==== Header and footer ====
%
% I have defined an outer theme called "zzinfolines."
% Use
%  \useoutertheme{zzinfolines}
% after \usetheme{...}.


%==== vertical alignment of materials on a slide ===
%
% By default, materials on a slide are vertically centered.
% To make them start at the top, use the 't' class option:
%
% \documentclass[t]{beamer}
%
% Or, to change the alignment of a single frame, use
%
% \begin{frame}[t]
% or
% \begin{frame}[c]


%==== using colors ====
%
% Use color syntax defined in the package "color":
%
% {\color{colorname} ... }
%
% Remember to use { and } to restrict its scope of impact.
% Some common color names are predefined.
% To define new color names.  Use
%
% \definecolor{colorname}{rgb}{r,g,b}
%
% Color works in math mode as well;
% it's easy to make different parts of a formula
% in different colors.


%==== movies, animations, and sound ====
%
% We usually want to play animations or sounds "on the spot"
% instead of opening another program.
%
% Use the 'multimedia' package which is part of the
% 'beamer' distribution but must be explicitly loaded.
% Then use the \movie command.
%
% I have noticed that \movie does not recognize
% the 'MP4' file format. There may be other problems.
%
% If \movie fails, try the 'movie15' package.


%==== links to external files ====
%
% Use
%
% \href{URL}{text}
%
% from the "hyperref" package.
% "URL" is either a full URL or relative to the base URL defined by
%
% \hyperbaseurl{}
%
% "text" is the clickable appearrance of the link.
% It can be text, pictures, or whatever.
%
% The PDF viewer will open up the default program to show (or play)
% the external file:
